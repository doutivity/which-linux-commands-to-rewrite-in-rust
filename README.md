# Opportunities to create Rust-based replacements for classic Linux utilities

A list of popular Linux commands that have already been rewritten in Rust.
The goal of this list is to help you transition to Rust: you can either choose a Linux command and rewrite it yourself, estimating the workload by checking the number of lines of code in its C repository, or find ongoing projects and contribute to them.
It also shows which popular TUIs are commonly used in Rust when rewriting commands from C to Rust.

Status: ⚠️ Work in progress
